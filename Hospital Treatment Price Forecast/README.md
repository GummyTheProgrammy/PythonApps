# Hospital Treatment Price Forecast

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning-based model to predict hospital treatment prices using the "Medical Cost Personal Datasets" from Kaggle. It leverages ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost to forecast individual medical charges based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The model achieves an R² score of approximately 0.89, with interactive visualizations to explore predictions and feature importance. The work includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and advanced modeling to support healthcare cost estimation and policy insights.

## Features
- Predictive modeling with Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly for better data insight.
- Analysis of key predictors (e.g., smoking as the strongest factor).
- Exportable predictions in CSV format for further use.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Open `Hospital_Treatment_Price_Forecast.ipynb` in Google Colab.
3. Run the notebook cells to load data, train models, and visualize results.
4. Explore the `predicoes.csv` file for predicted vs. actual charges.
