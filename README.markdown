# PythonApps

PythonApps is a collection of Python-based applications designed to demonstrate practical programming, modular architecture, and real-world functionality. Each app is self-contained, showcasing different use cases, from data analysis to GUI-driven tools. The first app, **EcomReport**, generates detailed e-commerce sales reports with visualizations and PDF export. More apps will be added to explore diverse Python applications.
